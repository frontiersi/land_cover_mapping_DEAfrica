    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not uncommon that existing training data were collected at different time period than the study period. This means the dataset may not reflect the real ground cover due to temporal changes. FAO adopted a training data filtering method for any given reference year that is within a time span (e.g. 5 years) from an existing baseline, and tested the method in the production of land cover mapping for Lesotho. It is assumed that the majority of reference labels will remain valid from one year to the previous/next. Based on this assumption, the reference labels which have changed are the minority, and should be detectable through the use of outlier detection methods like K-Means clustering. More details on the method and how it works for Lesotho can be found in the published paper ([De Simone et al 2022](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/14/14/3294))."

    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will implement FAO's automatic filtering of a training dataset for a target year using points from a geojson or shapefile and a reference classification map of a previous year. The steps include:\n",
    "1. Load extracted training features\n",
    "2. Generate stratified random samples for each class on the reference land cover map using `random_sampling` and extract their features using `collect_training_data`\n",
    "3. Train K-Means models using the extracted features of the random samples\n",
    "4. Apply clustering on training features and remove minor clusters\n",
    "5. Export the filtered training features to disk for use in subsequent scripts\n",

To exclude other pixel values (e.g. 0, 255) than the valid land cover classes from being sampled, we first assign these values on the map as NaN.

The index is the ratio of the sum of between-clusters dispersion and of within-cluster dispersion for all clusters, where the index is higher when clusters are dense and well separated. More information about can be checked [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#calinski-harabasz-index).
