    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training data** is the most important part of any supervised machine learning workflow. The quality of the training data has a greater impact on the classification than the algorithm used. Large and accurate training data sets are preferable: increasing the training sample size results in increased classification accuracy ([Maxell et al 2018](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01431161.2018.1433343)).  A review of training data methods in the context of Earth Observation is available [here](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/6/1034) \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many platforms to use for gathering land cover training labels, the best one to use depends on your application. GIS platforms are great for collection training data as they are highly flexible and mature platforms; [Geo-Wiki](https://www.geo-wiki.org/) and [Collect Earth Online](https://collect.earth/home) are two open-source websites that may also be useful depending on the reference data strategy employed. Alternatively, there are many pre-existing training datasets on the web that may be useful, e.g. [Radiant Earth](https://www.radiant.earth/) manages a growing number of reference datasets for use by anyone. With locations of land cover labels available, we can extract features at these locations from satellite imagery as input for machine learning."

    "This notebook will extract training feature layers from the `open-data-cube` of Sentinel-2 multispectral images using geometries within a geojson.\n",

    "To do this, we rely on a custom function called `collect_training_data`, contained within the [deafrica_tools.classification](../../../../Tools/deafrica_tools/classification.py) script.  The principal goal of this notebook is to familarise users with this function so they can extract the appropriate data for their use-case. The default example also highlights extracting a set of useful feature layers for land cover classification. The workflow includes the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Preview the points in our training data by plotting them on a basemap\n",
    "2. Define a feature layer function to pass to `collect_training_data`\n",

    "Below, we will define a more complicated feature layer function than the brief example shown above. Firstly We will calculate the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which is commonly used to distinguish between vegetation and non-vegetation land cover classes. We use the `calculate_indices`function to automatically calculate NDVI for all specified bands. The `calculate_indicies` function provides an easier way to calculate a wide range of remote sensing indices, without explicitly needing to write the code of the band math. More information on calculating band indices can be found in [DE Africa’s documentation](https://docs.digitalearthafrica.org/en/latest/sandbox/notebooks/Frequently_used_code/Calculating_band_indices.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we'll use temporal signatures to help distinguish land cover classes with seasonal patterns (e.g. croplands) with others. To reduce data size while keeping seasonal changes, we are implementing bimonthly temporal aggregation, i.e. geomedian (sometimes referred to as the 'geometric median') for each pixel location. The significance of the geomedian is that all bands are considered simultaneously. This maintains the spectral relationship between bands, providing the most representative value. Additionally, the geomedian statistic reduces spatial noise and improves colour balance compared to similar statistics such as the median or medoid. More information on geomedian and available geomedian products can be found in [DE Africa's documentation](https://docs.digitalearthafrica.org/en/latest/data_specs/GeoMAD_specs.html).\n",
    "> Note: A shorter time interval could be chosen to obtain a finer-grained temporal signatures, but it would also result in larger data gaps in the satellite time-series due to presence of cloud and cloud shadow. If cloud presence in your study site is very frequent, you may need to choose a courser temporal aggregates, e.g. every three months.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the output of the feature layer function should only contain coordinates with no time dimension, we need to convert the temporal features of each measurement to multiple individual features. For example, we will rename and convert the bimonthly temporal features for blue band to blue_0, blue_2, ..., blue_5.\n",
