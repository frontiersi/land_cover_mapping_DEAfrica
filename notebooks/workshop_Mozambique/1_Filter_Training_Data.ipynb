    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not uncommon for existing training data to be collected over a different time period than that of the study period. Meaning that a dataset may not reflect the real ground cover due to temporal changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) adopted a training data filtering method for any given reference year that is within a time span (e.g. 5 years) from an existing baseline, and tested the method in the production of land cover mapping for Lesotho. It is assumed that the majority of reference labels will remain valid from one year to the previous/next. Based on this assumption, the reference labels which have changed are the minority, and should be detectable through the use of outlier detection methods like K-Means clustering. More details on the method and how it works for Lesotho can be found in the published paper ([De Simone et al 2022](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/14/14/3294))."

For a quick demonstration let's sample 1000 pixels in total. To fit in memory we sample over only a subset (5000 by 5000 pixels) of the map.
